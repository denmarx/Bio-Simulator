# Enzymatic Digestion Simulation  
This molecular simulation tool offers an interactive approach to understanding the enzymatic digestion process at the molecular level. Developed using the Matter.js physics engine and built on React, this application simulates a dynamic water environment where users can explore the impact of various conditions on the digestion of macronutrients.  

## Features  
### Interactive Simulation:  
Users can adjust pH and temperature using sliders to create optimal conditions for enzyme activity.  
### Macronutrient Addition:  
Add carbohydrates, proteins, and lipids to the simulation and observe how different enzymes interact with them.
### Enzyme Activity:  
Includes enzymes such as amylase, pepsin, and lipase, each with specific conditions for optimal activity.
### Dynamic Environment:  
Water particles and protons are simulated to reflect changes in temperature and pH.
### Real-time Feedback:  
Enzymes move and digest macronutrients when conditions are optimal, providing immediate visual feedback.
## How It Works  
### Water Simulation:  
Water particles wobble at varying speeds based on the temperature setting.
### pH and Temperature Control:  
Sliders allow users to adjust the pH and temperature of the environment.
### Enzyme Interaction:  
Enzymes are activated under optimal conditions and begin digesting macronutrients by bumping into them and removing them from the simulation.
### Proton Simulation:  
Proton quantity is controlled by the pH slider, affecting the overall environment.
## Future Updates
* Enhanced enzyme shapes and behaviors.
* More detailed and accurate simulation of the digestion process.
